Release history for libmodulemd

2.15.1      2025-05-09

Fixes:
- A new "g_variant_store: assertion 'data != NULL' failed" warning added to
  GLib 2.84.1 when processing modulemd YAML documents with /data/xmd field with
  an empty flow map ({}) value was fixed.
- Building documentation now works with GLib 2.80.1 at the expense of missing
  cross links from libmodulemd to GLib. If it still fails you, you can disable
  building the documentation with "-Dwith_docs=false" meson option.
- A number of warnings printed by recent Meson was reduced.


2.15.0      2023-05-10

Enhancements:
- Add a support for decompressing Zstandard-compressed YAML files.
  modulemd_detect_compression() function now recognizes files with "zst" file
  name extension and files with Zstandard magic bytes and returns
  MODULEMD_COMPRESSION_TYPE_ZSTD_COMPRESSION constant for them.
  modulemd_module_index_update_from_file() can load Zstandard-compressed YAML
  files now.
- Remove a dependency on "file" library (libmagic). libmodulemd now implements
  its own detection of supported compression formats. This saves roughly 9 MB
  from a minimal system installation.
- An XML specification for in-YUM-repository metadata is available in
  "xml_specs" directory. This new format aspires for replacing modulemd-v2,
  modulemd-defaults-v1 and modulemd-translations-v1 YAML formats. A motivation
  is to unify with other XML files in YUM repositories. Please note that this
  specification is not yet implemented.

Incompatible changes:
- Meson minimal version increased to 0.55.

Deprecation:
- Deprecate intents in modulemd-defaults specification. System intents, which
  parameterize a default stream and default profiles of a module, were never
  implemented in the package managers (e.g. DNF). Users are discouraged from
  using this feature. Future libmodulmed versions might deprecate and later
  remove parts of an API pertaining the intents.

Fixes:
- Fix a crash when converting a modulemd-packager object with a default
  profile and without a module name or stream to a module index.
- Fix parsing empty profiles. Previously a profile with an empty rpms list was
  misparsed as a list with a single, empty package name.
- A specification for modulemd-v2 format was corrected to require a "content"
  license subtree only if the module build contains artifacts.
- Double-quote strings in scalar YAML values when they look like a number.
  Most of the fields in the YAML files are required to be interpreted as
  strings. Unaware third-party parsers could misinterpret number-like strings
  (e.g. 2.30) as floats (i.e. 2.3), leading to mismatching string
  representations. This is now prevented by quoting these values (i.e.
  "2.30").
- A build script now correctly asserts a requested Python version. Previously
  Python 3 /usr/bin/python program could be mistaken with Python 2
  interpreter.
- meson-0.64.0 warnings about "check" option of run_command() were fixed.
- Warnings from g_str_equal() macro of glib2 about passing an unsigned
  char * to strcmp() were fixed.


2.14.0      2022-02-04

This release is fully compatible with the previous version 2.13.0 except
behaviour changes described in Fixes section.

Enhancements:
- New functions for stripping XMD from an index
  (modulemd_module_index_clear_xmds()), from a module
  (modulemd_module_clear_xmds()), and from a version 2 module stream
  (modulemd_module_stream_v2_clear_xmd()). This enables you to prevent from leaking
  private build options to output modulemd-v2 documents.
- Interpret an invalid buildorder 18446744073709551615 as -1 if the library
  is built with a new build boolean accept_overflowed_buildorder set to true.
- Document module version, buildorder, and epoch limits in the specifications.
  Also clarify that an epoch number at RPM artifacts is mandatory.
- Document that modulemd_module_get_defaults can return NULL
- Improve a documentation for modulemd_module_set_defaults() and
  modulemd_module_index_upgrade_defaults() functions.
- Improve modulemd-validator(1) manual page.
- Drop a build dependency on help2man tool.

Fixes:
- Fix a crash when updating an index with an invalid subdocument and a NULL
  error parameter.
- Fix clobbering module defaults on a modulemd_module_set_defaults() error.
- Fix modulemd_module_index_upgrade_defaults() to actually use the requested
  version.
- Reject duplicate contexts in modulemd-packager-v3 documents.
- Report an error if modulemd-validator tool is invoked with both --version
  option and an unknown option.
- Fix an undefined behaviour when comparing integers of different signs.
- Fix DNF examples in a documentation.
- Actually execute modulemd-obsoletes Python tests.
- Fix deprecation warnings in tests with glib2-2.69.0.
- Fix deprecation warnings in Python tests and make the test compatible with
  Python 3.11.


2.13.0      2021-07-09

This release is fully compatible with the previous 2.12.1 version.

Enhancements:
- Add /data/demodularized/rpms list to modulemd and modulemd-packager formats.
  The listed binary RPM package names will be handled by a package manager as
  removed from all previous module versions. This enables moving a package from
  a module to a non-modular package set.
- modulemd-validator tool enables you to constrain a document type with a new
  "--type" option. Without this option, all document types recognized by
  a modulemd index are accepted. To validate version 3 of modulemd-packager
  format, use "modulemd-validator --type modulemd-packager-v3 foo.yaml"
  command.
- Allow disabling Python 3. You can pass -Dwith_py3=false to a meson setup
  command to disable building a binding for Python 3. The binding is enabled
  by default.

Fixes:
- Reject invalid integers. Purely non-numeric values and negative numbers where
  an unsigned type is mandated by a specification raise a parser error now.
- Handle a failed g_setenv() call in modulemd-validator.
- Prevent from dereferencing a NULL pointer when reporting invalid
  subdocuments.
- A build script now refuses to disable Glib introspection
  (-Dskip_introspection=true) while a Python binding is requested
  (-Dwith_py3=true).
- "modulemd-validator --version" command returns 0 exit code now.


2.12.1      2021-05-03

This is a bug-fix release fully compatible with the previous 2.12.0
version. Notable changes:

Enhancements:
- Improve diagnostic messages for compression tests.
- Tests performed in a GitHub continues integration are faster.
- Use GitHub actions to perform CI tests also on ArchLinux, Mageia,
  Mandriva, and OpenSUSE.

Fixes:
- Relax context value up to 13 characters including an underscore
  character in modulemd v2 format. This reenables scratch-builds in MBS.
- Migrate Packit tests from a deprecated current_version_command to
  a newer actions/get-current-version.


2.12.0      2021-01-15

Enhancements:
- Enable component 'buildorder' for modulemd-packager v2 and v3 documents.

Fixes:
- When adding obsoletes ensure index has stream mdversion at least 2.
- Add missing @staticmethod for python2.
