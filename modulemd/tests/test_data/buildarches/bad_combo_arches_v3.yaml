  summary: Javascript runtime
  description: >-
    Node.js is a platform built on Chrome''s JavaScript runtime for easily building
    fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking
    I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
    real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
