    # this module can be built or run against.
    # Dependency keys are module names, dependency values are lists of
    # required streams.  The lists can be both inclusive (listing compatible
    # streams) or exclusive (accepting every stream except for those listed).
    # An empty list implies all active existing streams are supported.
    # Requiring multiple streams at build time will result in multiple
    # builds.  Requiring multiple streams at runtime implies the module
    # is compatible with all of them.  If the same module streams are listed
    # in both the build time and the runtime block, the build tools translate
    # the runtime block so that it matches the stream the module was built
    # against.  Multiple builds result in multiple output modulemd files.
    # See below for an example.
