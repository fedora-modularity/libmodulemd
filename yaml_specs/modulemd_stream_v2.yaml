# build system: The process by which a module is built and packaged. In many #
# cases, this will be the Module Build Service tool, but this term is used   #
# as a catch-all to describe any mechanism for producing a yum repository    #
# containing modular content from input module metadata files.               #
#                                                                            #

# MANDATORY: Attributes of this type must be filled in by the packager of    #
# this module. They must also be preserved and provided in the output        #

# preserved and provided in the output metadata produced by the build        #

# AUTOMATIC: Attributes of this type must be present in the repository       #
# metadata, but they may be left unspecified by the packager. In this case,  #
# the build system is responsible for generating an appropriate value for    #
# the attribute and including it in the repository metadata. If the packager #
# specifies this attribute explicitly, it must be preserved and provided in  #
# the output metadata for inclusion into a repository.                       #
#                                                                            #
# The definitions above describe the expected behavior of the build system   #
# operating in its default configuration. It is permissible for the build    #
# system to override user-provided entries through non-default operating     #
# modes. If such changes are made, all items indicated as being required for #
# the output repository must still be present.                               #
